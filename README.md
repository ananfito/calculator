## About
A basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JS. Inspired by the tutorial ['JavaScript DOM Manipulation Course'](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by [CodeLab](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeLab98), this is a self-directed project I created to challenge myself and test the skills I learned from the tutorial. 

### Goals

This will be a basic calculator and have the following functions: 

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`

## Status

This project is a **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**. Check back for updates.
